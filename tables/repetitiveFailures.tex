\caption[Repetitive Flaky Failures within and across tests per project]{Repetitive Flaky Failures within and across tests per project. \\
\textnormal{Failures column shows the number of flaky failures and the different failures (Set). The columns (1:n) and [1] refer to flaky failures that are and are not repetitives, respectively.  Per Test refers to matching the failures within the same test. Across Tests refers matching all flaky failures from all tests.}
