% This is similar to the Table~\ref{nonunique}, but for the failures that flakes once (which have no match with other flaky failures). For the columns \textit{Failures Flake =1}: it shows the number of failures that flakes once (\textbf{f}), follow by the total number of tests where these failures belong (\textbf{t}), followed by the number of tests where the whole test only flakes once (\textbf{t_{1}})

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption[Top 10 Most Occurrence Exception in Flaky and True Failures]{Top 10 Most Occurrence Exception in Flaky and True Failures \\ 
\textnormal{ The \textit{Exception Occurrence} column details the frequency of a specific exception, indicating in how many projects, tests, and failures this exception has been observed. The \textit{Match Result (with Stacktraces)} column displays the match distributions, considering stacktraces and the related test count while the, \textit{Match Result (without Stacktraces)} column indicates match results based on exception types, excluding stacktraces.}}
