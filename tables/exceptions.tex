\caption[List of top 10 Exceptions in flaky failures.]{
\textnormal{The Occurrence column denotes the count of failures associated with these exceptions and indicates the number of projects in which these failures originate from.
The With Stacktrace columns provide the count of each exception (including the stacktrace) that occur exclusively in flaky failures, as well as when they occur in non-flaky failures.
The Without Stacktrace (w/o) column corresponds to the With Stacktrace column, but excludes the consideration of stacktraces.}}
