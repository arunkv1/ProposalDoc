    \caption[FlakeFlagger List of Collected Features.]{Complete list of features captured for test flakiness prediction. The Covered Lines Churn feature is represented in multiple forms based on the $h$ values (number of the past commits). In the evaluation, I considered $h=5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 500$ and $10,000$}

\parbox[t]{2mm}{\multirow{8}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{Test Smells}}}	&
	Indirect Testing  	&	 True if the test interacts with the object under test via an intermediary \cite{van2001refactoring}  \\
	&	Eager Testing 	&	 True if the test exercises more than one method of the tested object \cite{van2001refactoring} \\
	&	Test Run War  	&	 True if the test allocates a file or resource which might be used by other tests \cite{van2001refactoring} \\
	&	Conditional Logic 	&	 True if the test has a conditional if-statement within the test method body \cite{meszaros2007xunit} \\
	&	Fire and Forget  	&	 True if the test launches background threads or tasks. \cite{garousi2018smells} \\
	&	Mystery Guest 	&	 True if the test accesses external resources  \cite{van2001refactoring} \\
	&	Assertion Roulette  	&	 True if the test has multiple assertions \cite{van2001refactoring} \\
	&	Resources Optimism  	&	 True if the test accesses external resources without checking their availability \cite{van2001refactoring}\\ \hline
\parbox[t]{2mm}{\multirow{8}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{Numeric Features}}}	&	Test Lines of Code   	&	 Number of lines of code in the test method body \\
	&	Number  of Assertions  	&	 Number of assertions checked by the test \\
	&	Execution Time   	&	 Running time for the test execution \\
	&	Source Covered Lines  	&	 Number of lines covered by each test, counting only production code \\
	&	Covered Lines  	&	 Total number of lines of code covered by the test  \\
	&	Source Covered Classes  	&	 Total number of production classes covered by each test \\
	&	External Libraries  	&	 Number of external libraries used by the test \\
	&	Covered Lines Churn 	&	 $h$-index capturing churn of covered lines in past 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 500, and 10,000 commits. Each value $h$ indicates that at least $h$ lines were modified at least $h$ times in that period.\\
