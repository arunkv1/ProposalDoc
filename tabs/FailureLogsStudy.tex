\caption{How often do flaky test failures match other flaky failures.}
% \textnormal{ 1) Total Flaky Tests and Failures shows the number of flaky tests, and the failure frequency of those flaky test.\\
% 2) Matching each test failure against other observed failures of the same test (in different test suite run). We bucket each test by the number of test suite run that it failed in, and show the number of tests that failed that many times (F), and the percentage of failures of those tests that matched at least one other failure of the same test (called Non-Unique (NU)). \textbf{S} refers to a failure that has one single occurrence because a test only fails once.\\
% 3) Matching each test failure against a DIFFERENT test failure in the same test suite run as that failure. We bucket each test suite run by the total number of flaky test failures observed in that build, showing the total number of flaky tests that failed in test suite runs of that bucket (F), and the percentage of failures that matched at least one other failure in the same test suite run (NU). \textbf{S} refers to a test suite run that has one single flaky failure.\\ 
% 4) We chose to opt out the projects that have one flaky test reported in studied dataset. }}
